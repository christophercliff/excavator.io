[Chris][homepage] here, creator of the Excavator project. Today I'm officially retiring the [excavator.io][excavator] and decommissioning all services. The project has been on hiatus for the past several months and I simply don't have the resources to continue development. My sincere thanks to everyone who signed up.

Excavator is a Google Chrome™ extension and web application for collecting responsive screenshots. The project was started in December 2012 and retired in April 2014.
